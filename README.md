# tiny-es6
Small collection of es6 polyfills that should work under any es5 environment or es5-shim.

Basically, this is the set of ES6 I expect to use routinely. Firefox, Opera and Chrome already
implement these.

Any additions I make here will be lightweight.

For more on what ES6 can be used now, see
[my blog post](http://codersnext.com/es6-features-you-can-use-now/)
that accompanied this repository.
