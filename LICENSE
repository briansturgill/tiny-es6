This is a collecton of some shims from https://developer.mozilla.org
As these by necessity would have been created after 2010, this page:
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/About#Copyrights_and_licenses
says they would be in the public domain.
I have modified them lightly.
I release those modifications to the public domain.
